# Notes On How To Shoot

### How to shoot with DSLR

Steps:

1. Frame Rate. Use 30fps on 1920px.
1. Shutter Speed. Ideally, twice as much as Frame Rate => 60.
1. Aperture. Depends on lens. Use least possible.
1. ISO. Use the least possible. Based on aperture. Make sure exposure is good, AND ISO is not too low.
1. (!) A variable ND filter may actually compensate the exposure if necessary.

1. Set white balance via grey card. (See Custom White Balance instructions in the user manual.)

### Things to think about

* What kind of lighting I'm going to have?
* What is the setting (such as colors of the wall)?

Takstar SGC-598 seems to be a decent mic to start with.
