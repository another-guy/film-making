# Nature of Blogging

## General ideas

* Do a _different_ thing, cause that's what makes one potentially popular out of the sea of _available_.
* Vlogging is marathon, _not sprint_. Greatness takes time and patience. Commit to the thing and grind!
* Don't forget you're working for yourself. Most people do not hustle during their after hours, so have respect.

## Define Yourself

> Career development <> focusing on software developers in colleges.
